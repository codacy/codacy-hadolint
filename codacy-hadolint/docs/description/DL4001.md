## Either use Wget or Curl but not both.

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian
RUN wget http://google.com
RUN curl http://bing.com
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian
RUN curl http://google.com
RUN curl http://bing.com
```

### Rationale:

Don't install two tools that have the same effect and avoid the additional cruft.
