## Specify version with `yum install -y <package>-<version>`

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
RUN yum install -y httpd && yum clean all
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
RUN yum install -y httpd-2.24.2 && yum clean all
```

### Rationale:
> Version pinning forces the build to retrieve a particular version regardless of what’s in the cache. This technique can also reduce failures due to unanticipated changes in required packages.

### Notes:
If you need downgrade an already installed package to an older version, use `yum downgrade -y <package_name>-<version_info>`
