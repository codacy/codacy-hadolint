## Multiple consecutive `RUN` instructions. Consider consolidation.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
RUN command_creating_big_files     # big files stored in image layer!
RUN command_deleting_these_files
```

or
```Dockerfile
RUN command_updating_package_info  # cached in image layer and not fresh!
RUN command_using_package_info
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
RUN command_creating_big_files \
 && command_deleting_these_files
```

or, respectively
```Dockerfile
RUN command_updating_package_info \
 && command_using_package_info
```

### Rationale:
Each `RUN` instruction will create a new layer in the resulting image. Therefore consolidating consecutive `RUN` instructions will reduce the layer count. This will reduce the size of the image if it allows temporary files to be deleted in the same RUN instruction as the one that created them (see https://docs.docker.com/develop/dev-best-practices/).
In addition to that, each `RUN` runs in its own shell, which can be the source of confusion when part of a `RUN` instruction changes something about the environment, because these changes may vanish in the next `RUN` instruction.

### Drawbacks

Please review Docker's layer caching. In general you want layers first which don't change often, so they can be cached. Putting easy cacheable and non-cacheable commands in the same layer (by using one `RUN` command) might have negative performance issues. You might want to ignore this `info` level rule.
