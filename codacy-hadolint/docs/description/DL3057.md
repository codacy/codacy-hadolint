## `HEALTHCHECK` instruction missing.

This is an optional rule which is disabled by default. To enable it, set its severity to the preferred level, e.g.
```Bash
$ hadolint --warning=DL3057 Dockerfile
```

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
HEALTHCHECK CMD /bin/health
```
or
```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
HEALTHCHECK NONE
```

### Rationale:
When it is required to define a health check (e.g. by company policy), it must not be omitted.

### Note:
This rule is disabled by default, because a `HEALTHCHECK` is not desirable in all circumstances. Images used with Kubernetes for example do not benefit from a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction, as Kubernetes brings its own mechanisms to accomplish the same thing. If however it is desired, this rule makes sure a build stage either has a `HEALTHCHECK` instruction, or inherits it from an earlier build stage.
