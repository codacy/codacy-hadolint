# Use ./\*glob* or -- \*glob* so names with dashes won't become options.

### Problematic code:
    rm *

### Correct code:

    rm ./*

or

    rm -- *

### Rationale

Since files and arguments are strings passed the same way, programs can't properly determine which is which, and rely on dashes to determine what's what.

A file named `-f` (`touch -- -f`) will not be deleted by the problematic code. It will instead be interpreted as a command line option, and `rm` will even report success.

Using `./*` will instead cause the glob to be expanded into `./-f`, which no program will treat as an option.

Similarly, `--` by convention indicates the end of options, and nothing after it will be treated like flags (except for some programs possibly still special casing `-` as e.g. stdin).

Note that changing `*` to `./*` in GNU Tar parameters will add `./` prefix to path names in the created archive. This may cause subtle problems (eg. to search for a specific file in archive, the `./` prefix must be specified as well). So using `-- *` is a safer fix for GNU Tar commands.

`echo` and `printf` does not have issues unless the glob is the first word in the command. ShellCheck 0.7.2+ does not warn for these commands.
