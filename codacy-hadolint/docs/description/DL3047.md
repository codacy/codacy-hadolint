## Use `wget --progress` to avoid excessively bloated build logs

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20
RUN wget https://example.com/big_file.tar
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20
RUN wget --progress=dot:giga https://example.com/big_file.tar
```

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:20
RUN wget -nv https://example.com/big_file.tar
```

### Rationale:

`wget` without flag `--progress` will result in excessively bloated build logs when downloading larger files. That's because it outputs a line for each fraction of a percentage point while downloading a big file.
