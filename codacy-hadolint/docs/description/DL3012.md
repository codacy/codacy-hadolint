## Provide an email adress or URL as maintainer.

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
MAINTAINER lukas
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
MAINTAINER Lukas Martinelli <me@lukasmartinelli.ch>
```

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
MAINTAINER Lukas Martinelli http://lukasmartinelli.ch
```
### Rationale:

If you only have a name and not ane mail address or URL no one can contact
you and therefore the `MAINTAINER` information could also be ommited.
