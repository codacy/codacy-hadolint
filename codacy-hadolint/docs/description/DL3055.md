## Label `<label>` is not a valid git hash.
This rule is activated by specifying a label-schema including a label of type `hash`. This can be done via command line
```bash
$ hadolint --require-label refno:hash Dockerfile
```
or in the config file:
```yaml
label-schema:
  refno: hash
```
### Problematic code:
```Dockefile
LABEL refno="abc-not-a-git-hash-def"
```
### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL refno="0ef48a1"
```
### Rationale:
[Some standards](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/annotations.md) require a source control identifier be specified for the software within an image.

### Note:
This rule does not expand variables. It requires the value of a label to be a literal git hash, though both short (7-digit) and long (40-digit) hashes are ok.
