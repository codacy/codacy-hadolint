## Label `<label>` does not conform to semantic versioning.

This rule is activated by specifying a label-schema including a label of type `semver`. This can be done via command line
```bash
$ hadolint --require-label version:semver Dockerfile
```
or in the config file:
```yaml
label-schema:
  version: semver
```

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL version="something-other-than-a-version-number"
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL version="1.0.0-rc1"
```

### Rationale:
Specifying a version either for the resulting image or for the software contained within is often a crucial part of release engineering. [Semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) allows to do so in a well understood manner, which also communicates extend of changes between versions or possible incompatibilities.

### Note:
This rule does not expand variables. It requires the value of a label to be a literal semantic version number.
