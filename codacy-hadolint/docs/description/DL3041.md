## Specify version with `dnf install -y <package>-<version>`
### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
RUN dnf install -y httpd && dnf clean all
```
### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
RUN dnf install -y httpd-2.24.2 && dnf clean all
```
### Rationale:

> Version pinning forces the build to retrieve a particular version regardless of what’s in the cache. This technique can also reduce failures due to unanticipated changes in required packages.

### Notes:

If you need downgrade an already installed package to an older version, use `dnf downgrade -y <package_name>-<version_info>`
