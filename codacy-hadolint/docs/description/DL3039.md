## Do not use `dnf update`
### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
FROM fedora
RUN dnf update -y
```
### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
FROM centos
```
### Rationale:

See [DL3005](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3005). Problems include:

  * Updates failing on packages from base images in unprivileged containers
  * Inconsistencies between builds producing problems for application developers
