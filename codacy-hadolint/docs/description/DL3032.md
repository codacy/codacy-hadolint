## `yum clean all` missing after yum command.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
RUN yum install -y httpd-2.24.2
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
RUN yum install -y httpd-2.24.2 && yum clean all
```

### Rationale:
Clean cached package data after installation to reduce image size.

### Notes:
Clean up must be performed in the same RUN step, otherwise it will not affect image size.
