## Do not use `yum update`

# Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN yum update -y
```

# Correct code:
```Dockerfile
FROM centos
```

# Rationale:
See [DL3005](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3005). Problems include:

  * Updates failing on packages from base images in unprivileged containers
  * Inconsistencies between builds producing problems for application developers
