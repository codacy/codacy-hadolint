# Do not refer to an environment variable within the same `ENV` statement where it is defined.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
ENV FOO=bar \
    BAZ=${FOO}/bla
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
ENV FOO=bar
ENV BAZ=${FOO}/bla
```

### Rationale:
Docker will not expand a variable within the same `ENV` statement where it is defined. While it will not crash Docker, it carries a high likelihood of errors.
