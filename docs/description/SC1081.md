## Scripts are case-sensitive. Use `if`, not `If`.

### Problematic code:

```sh
If true
Then
  echo "hello"
Fi
```

### Correct code:

```sh
if true
then
  echo "hello"
fi
```

### Rationale:

Shells are case sensitive and do not accept `If` or `IF` in place of lowercase `if`.

### Exceptions

If you're aware of this and insist on naming a function `WHILE`, you can quote the name to prevent shellcheck from thinking you meant `while`. Or if you really want the names, add things like `alias If=if IF=if` to replace those keywords and ask shellcheck to ignore them.
