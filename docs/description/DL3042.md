## Avoid cache directory with `pip install --no-cache-dir <package>`

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
RUN pip3 install MySQL_python
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
RUN pip3 install --no-cache-dir MySQL_python
```
### Rationale:

Once a package is installed, it does not need to be re-installed and the Docker cache can be leveraged instead. Since the pip cache makes the images larger and is not needed, it's better to disable it.
