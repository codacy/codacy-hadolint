## Label `<label>` is not a valid email format - must be conform to RFC5322.
This rule is activated by specifying a label-schema including a label of type email. This can be done via command line
```bash
$ hadolint --require-label maintainer:email Dockerfile
```
or in the config file:
```yaml
label-schema:
  maintainer: email
```
### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="foo-bar"
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL maintainer="foo@bar.com"
```

### Note:
This rule does not expand variables. It requires the value of a label to be a literal email compliant with [RFC 5322](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322).
