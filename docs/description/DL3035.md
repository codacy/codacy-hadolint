## Do not use `zypper update`

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.2
RUN zypper update -y
```
### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
FROM opensuse/leap:15.2
RUN zypper install -y httpd\>=2.4 && zypper clean
RUN zypper patch --cve=cve-2015-7547 && zypper clean
```
### Rationale:

See [DL3031](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3031), [DL3005](https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3005). Problems include:

  * Updates failing on packages from base images in unprivileged containers
  * Inconsistencies between builds producing problems for application developers

### Notes:
This rule lints against blanket updates and dist-upgrades, but allows more specific updates by two methods:

  * use `zypper install -y $PACKAGE>=$VERSION` to upgrade a particular package, giving a version requirement.
  * use `zypper patch` to mitigate particular security vulnerabilities.
