# **Do not use --platform= with FROM.**

## **Problematic code:**

`FROM --platform=x86 busybox`

## **Correct code:**

`FROM busybox`

## **Rationale:**

Specifying --platform= in the [docker file FROM clause](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) forces the Image to build only one target platform. This has a number of negative consequences:
* It is not possible to build a [multi-platform Image](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-official-images-now-multi-platform/) from this Docker file.
* The platform that you build on must be the same as the platform specified in `--platform=`

A better approach is to omit `FROM --platform` in the docker file and to specify in `buildx --platform=` during the build if control of the image platform target is needed.
