## Label `<label>` is not a valid SPDX license identifier.
This rule is activated by specifying a label-schema including a label of the type `spdx`
```yaml
label-schema:
  license: spdx
```
or via command line:
```bash
# hadolint --require-label license:spdx Dockerfile
```

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL license="Thou shall not copyright infringe"
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL license="BSD-3-Clause"
```

### Rationale:
This rule allows users to ensure a label contains a literal SPDX license identifier. This may be desirable as part of the release process, to ensure images released are properly licensed and the license can be detected by automated tools.

### Note:
This rule does not expand variables. The value of the label must be a literal SPDX license identifier. A list of valid license identifiers can be found [here](https://spdx.org/licenses/).
