## Do not use apt-get dist-upgrade.

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian
RUN apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade 
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian
RUN apt-get update && apt-get upgrade
```

### Rationale:

> ~Updates will be baked into the base images, so you don't need to run `apt-get upgrade` in your containers. Because of the isolation that happens this can often fail if something is trying to modify init or make device changes inside a container. It also produces inconsistent images because you no longer have one source of truth of how your application should run and what versions of dependencies are included in the image.~
