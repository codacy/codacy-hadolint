## Use the `-y` switch to avoid manual input `yum install -y <package>`

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN yum install httpd-2.24.4 && yum clean all
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
FROM centos
RUN yum install -y httpd-2.24.4 && yum clean all
```

### Rationale:
Without the `-y` flag or the equivalent `--assumeyes` flag, yum will not successfully install a package, because human input is expected. The `-y` flag makes yum assume 'yes' as the answer to prompts during the installation.
