# ONBUILD, FROM or MAINTAINER triggered from within ONBUILD instruction.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
ONBUILD ONBUILD /bin/true
ONBUILD FROM debian
ONBUILD MAINTAINER Ron Weasley
```

### Correct code:
None.
```Dockerfile
```

### Rationale:
These three cases are errors in Dockerfiles. See:
