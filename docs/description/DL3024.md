## FROM aliases (stage names) must be unique

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:jesse as build

RUN stuff

FROM debian:jesse as build

RUN more_stuff
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
FROM debian:jesse as build

RUN stuff

FROM debian:jesse as another-alias

RUN more_stuff
```
### Rationale:

Defining duplicate stage names results in an error.
