# `COPY` to a relative destination without `WORKDIR` set.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY foo bar
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
FROM scratch
COPY foo /bar
```
or
```Dockerfile
FROM scratch
WORKDIR /
COPY foo bar
```

### Rationale:
While `COPY`ing to a relative path is not problematic per sé, errors happen, when changes are introduced to the `WORKDIR` without updating the destination of the `COPY` command. Since it is easy to overlook this relationship, Hadolint emits this warning when no `WORKDIR` is set and `COPY` has a relative destination. This case is error prone and either setting the `COPY`-destination absolute or the `WORKDIR` explicitly will reduce the probability of having an error.
It is assumed, that when a `WORKDIR` is set, the programmer will make sure it works well together with the destination of the `COPY` statements.
