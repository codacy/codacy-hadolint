## Superfluous label(s) present.

This rule is only activated when linting with the `strict-labels` option. This can be specified via config file
```yaml
strict-labels: true
```
or via command line:
```bash
$ hadolint --strict-labels Dockerfile
```
Note, that when no label-schema is specified, all labels are considered superfluous by this rule.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
LABEL superfluous="this should not be here"
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
FROM busybox
```

### Rationale:
In certain situations, it may be desirable to ensure no labels other than those specified in the label-schema are present. This may be required to avoid information leakage, to not confuse label parsers or to ensure compliance to standards.
