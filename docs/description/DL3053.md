## Label `<label>` is not a valid time format - must be conform to RFC3339.
This rule is activated by specifying a label-schema including a label of type rfc3339. This can be done via command line
```bash
$ hadolint --require-label created:rfc3339 Dockerfile
```
or in the config file:
```yaml
label-schema:
  created: rfc3339
```
### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL created="today"
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL created="2021-03-23 13:04:29.300508335+01:00"
```

### Note:
This rule does not expand variables. It requires the value of a label to be a literal time stamp compliant with [RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339).
