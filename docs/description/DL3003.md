## Use absolute paths, or use WORKDIR to switch to a directory.

### Problematic code #1:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
RUN cd /usr/src/app && git clone git@github.com:lukasmartinelli/hadolint.git 
```

### Correct code #1 with `WORKDIR` (when current working directory should be changed):

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN git clone git@github.com:lukasmartinelli/hadolint.git
```

### Problematic code #2:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
RUN cd /usr/src/app && cp somedir/somefile ./someDirInUsrSrcApp/
```

### Correct code #2 with absolute paths (when current working directory should _not_ be changed):

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
RUN cp somedir/somefile /usr/src/app/someDirInUsrSrcApp/
```

### Rationale:

Only use `cd` in a subshell. Most commands can work with absolute paths and it in most cases not necessary
to change directories. Docker provides the `WORKDIR` instruction if you really need to change the current
working directory, but please mind its "side effects" (see below for more details).

### Exceptions:

When executed in a Subshell.

Please note that there may be side effects by the last `WORKDIR` instruction, as this is also (a) the current
working directory when the Docker container is finally started, or (b) the working directory for any `RUN`,
`CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, `COPY `and `ADD `instructions that follow it in the Dockerfile (see [Dockerfile `WORKDIR`
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#workdir)). Moreover using `cd` in a `RUN`
instruction also the advantage of being free of side effects afterwards: that is, it only affects this single
`RUN` instruction, but not any subsequent instructions.
