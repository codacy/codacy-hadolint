## Do not use apt as it is meant to be an end-user tool, use apt-get or apt-cache instead.

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
RUN apt install curl=1.1.0
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
RUN apt-get install curl=1.1.0
```
### Rationale:

`apt` is discouraged by the linux distributions as an unattended tool as its interface may suffer changes between versions. Better use the more stable `apt-get` and `apt-cache`
