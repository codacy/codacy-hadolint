## Multiple `HEALTHCHECK` instructions

### Problematic code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
HEALTHCHECK CMD /bin/healthcheck
[...]
HEALTHCHECK CMD /bin/something
```

### Correct code:

```dockerfile
FROM busybox
HEALTHCHECK CMD /bin/healthcheck
```
or
```dockerfile
FROM busybox
HEALTHCHECK NONE
```
### Rationale:

Providing more than one `HEALTHCHECK` instruction per stage is confusing, error prone and possibly makes for larger than necessary Docker images.

### Note:
This rule used to be `Provide an email adress or URL as maintainer.`, but that was deprecated and eventually replaced with the current rule.
