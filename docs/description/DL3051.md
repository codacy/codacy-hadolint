## Label `<label>` is empty.

This rule is activated by specifying a label-schema.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL oopsie=""
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL oopsie="whoopsie"
```

### Rationale
When a label is required by the specified label-schema, it should not be empty or else there would be no sense in requiring the label in the first place.
