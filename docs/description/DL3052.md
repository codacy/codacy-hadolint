## Label `<label>` is not a valid URL.

This rule is activated by specifying a label-schema, where one label must contain a URL:
```yaml
label-schema:
  website: url
```
or via command line:
```bash
$ hadolint --require-label website:url Dockerfile
```

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL website="not a url"
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
LABEL website="https://www.example.com"
```

### Rationale:
A label-schema may require a label to contain some URL, for example to ensure compliance to [standardized specifications](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/annotations.md).

### Note:
This rule does not expand variables. It requires the value of the label to be a literal URL.
