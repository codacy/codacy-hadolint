## `yarn cache clean` missing after `yarn install` was run.

### Problematic code:
```Dockerfile
RUN yarn install
```

### Correct code:
```Dockerfile
RUN yarn install \
 && yarn cache clean
```

### Rationale:
`yarn` keeps a local cache of downloaded packages. This unnecessarily increases image size. It can be cleared by executing `yarn cache clean`.
